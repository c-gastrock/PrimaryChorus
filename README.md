# PrimaryChorus
Chorus audio effect built in JUCE/C++. Based on the Korg LCR chorus from the Korg Wavestation.

Has a left, center, and right LFO, with the left and right being +/- 90 degrees out of phase with the center.

The depth and rate of each individual delay module can be controlled by a knob. There is also a wet/dry crossfade knob.
